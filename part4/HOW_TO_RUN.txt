To run the site correctly you need two terminals:

Terminal 1 – Part 3 (API):
  cd C:\Users\BEATS\Desktop\Test\holbertonschool-hbnb\part3
  python run.py
  (Keep it open until you see: Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000)

Terminal 2 – Part 4 (Frontend):
  cd C:\Users\BEATS\Desktop\Test\holbertonschool-hbnb\part4
  python server.py
  (NOT: python -m http.server 8000)

Then open the browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
(Login page appears first, then after login you'll see the Places page)

If you get error 404: You ran python -m http.server instead of python server.py
If you get error 502: Part 3 is not running — run python run.py from part3 folder
